Hello, Alexandre
I have already developed reflection contract according to your requirement and tested it using hardhat.
So I attached testscript.

To exclude a address from reflection, please use setIsDividendExempt().
Also reflection occurs whenever transfer or buy, sell.

I have already developed many smart contract.
For example, You can check furio-io/token, furio-io/farm (I invited furio github).
So I am sure I can work with your team very well as a solidity developer.

If you have any question, please let me know here.
